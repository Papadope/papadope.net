### HeyðŸ‘‹

I am Chris.

Basically, I'm a Greek guy wondering into the world of cybersecurity.
I'm interested in anything related to programming languages, cybersecurity, cybercrime, penetration testing, etc.

My future goal is to become a certified penetration tester and help people who want to work in this field as much as I can.

I love the community that has been created over time in TryHackMe and it is one of the main reasons I am so passionate about it. I love constantly learning new things and especially about things that have to do with technology.

Do not hesitate to contact me, even for a hello. You can find me in LinkedIn, Github and in TryHackMe & HackTheBox Discord Channels.

Now on KeyBase:
